# My cipher program

**I made this for fun and I was bored, but yeah heres the code**
**This program uses the MIT license, and I want some credit if you plan on using this code**

## how to contribute
1. clone the repo (fork it? idk)
im really assuming you know how to clone a git repo if you want to contribute

2. run the code, there is a makefile
if you just run 'make' it will automatically compile and run the code

3. submit a PR

ill take a look and most probably just merge it with the main branch
